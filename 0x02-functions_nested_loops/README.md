- You can only use \_putchar twice in your code

[2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c) - Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
- You can only use \_putchar twice in your code

[3-islower.c](./3-islower.c) - Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

- Prototype: int \_islower(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is lowercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

[4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c) - Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

- Prototype: int \_isalpha(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

[5-sign.c](./5-sign.c) - Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

- Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

[6-abs.c](./6-abs.c) - Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

- Prototype: int \_abs(int);

- Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
- Returns the value of the last digit

[8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c) - Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

- Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
- You can listen to [this soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btAfXqgMkPs) while coding :)

- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
- All your code should be in the main function
- You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

[100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c) - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- The two digits must be different
- 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
- Print only the smallest combination of two digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
- You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
- All your code should be in the main function

[101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c) - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.

- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- The three digits must be different
- 012, 120, 102, 021, 201, 210 are considered the same combination of the three digits 0, 1 and 2
- Print only the smallest combination of three digits
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with three digits
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
- You can only use putchar six times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
- All your code should be in the main function

[102-print_comb5.c](./102-print_comb5.c) - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

- The numbers should range from 0 to 99
- The two numbers should be separated by a space
- All numbers should be printed with two digits. 1 should be printed as 01
- The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
- The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
- 00 01 and 01 00 are considered as the same combination of the numbers 0 and 1
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
- You can only use putchar eight times maximum in your code
- You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
- All your code should be in the main function
